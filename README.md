# Neural-Networks-for-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that guides you through the process of using neural networks to recognize handwritten digits (0-9). The notebook is designed as a practice lab that combines theoretical insights with practical implementation steps.

## Contents
- Introduction to Neural Networks: Understanding the basic concepts behind neural networks.
- ReLU Activation Function: Dive into the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function and its importance in neural networks.
- Softmax Function: Explore the Softmax function and its role in multiclass classification tasks.
- Neural Network Implementation: Detailed steps to build and train a neural network using TensorFlow.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Python programming.
- Familiarity with the concepts of machine learning and neural networks.
- Installation of TensorFlow and other necessary Python packages (specified in the notebook).

## Exercises
The notebook includes exercises designed to solidify your understanding and allow you to apply the concepts discussed:

- Exercise 1: Implement the Softmax function.
- Exercise 2: Construct and train your neural network model.
